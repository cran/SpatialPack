Description: Tools to assess the association between two spatial processes. Currently,
  several methodologies are implemented: A modified t-test to perform hypothesis testing
  about the independence between the processes, a suitable nonparametric correlation
  coefficient, the codispersion coefficient, and an F test for assessing the multiple
  correlation between one spatial process and several others. Functions for image
  processing and computing the spatial association between images are also provided.
  Functions contained in the package are intended to accompany Vallejos, R., Osorio, F.,
  Bevilacqua, M. (2020). Spatial Relationships Between Two Georeferenced Variables:
